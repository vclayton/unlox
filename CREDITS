I didn't come up with all this from scratch. I borrowed heavily from others' tutorials and mods.

Code taken from:
http://quakestyle.telefragged.com/quake3/tutorial2.htm (default grappling hook)
http://quakestyle.telefragged.com/quake3/tutorial5.htm (offhand grappling hook)
http://code3arena.planetquake.gamespy.com/tutorials/tutorial19.shtml - Destroyable turrets (and missiles)
